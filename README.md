## What is Future Hack?
Future Hack is a hackathon organised by [Digital McKinsey](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/how-we-help-clients/digital-labs) in partnership with [Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) and [Generation](https://www.generationinitiative.org/). The aim of this hackathon is to get **final year undergraduate / postgraduate South African students** thinking about ways in which they can play a role in solving societal problems using technology.

## How will Future Hack work?
In pure hackathon fashion, Future Hack will take place over a weekend of non-stop learning, problem solving and 'hacking' in Johannesburg on the 13 - 15th October 2017. Participants will spend the weekend in teams using their innovative and entrepreneurial mindset to build a digital solution to a problem currently faced by [Generation](https://www.generationinitiative.org/about/) - a global social enterprise aimed at eradicating youth unemployment.

The team with the winning solution will be awarded an all expense paid trip to the [Facebook F8 conference 2018](https://www.fbf8.com/) hosted in Silicon Valley.

 - Your description of this problem and solution must be submitted in Section 3 of this application.
 - Ensure that the solution you come up with is in the form of a software or hardware product.
 - The significance of the problem as well as the impact and innovation of your solution will be crucial in our evaluation of your application for the hackathon.
 - Please note that this is a vital element to determine success in the application form so please be articulate in describing your solution to the problem you've chosen.

### 2. Coding challenge
 - Build a single page website that advertises the solution you proposed in the problem solving challenge above.
 - Ensure that your website describes the problem you identified and how the solution you proposed would solve it.
 - Note that the visual design and functionality of the website will be crucial in our evaluation of your application for the hackathon.
 - This website can only be built using [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) and vanilla [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) **OR** [React JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/).
 - You can use boilerplates such as [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) for your project - this is free.
